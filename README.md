# Adaline

A rust implementation of the Adaline algorithm.

## Introduction

This repository contains a Rust implementation of the Adaline algorithm, an artificial neural network algorithm that uses gradient descent to update the weights of the network.

## Files

- `main.rs`: The entry point of the program, where the Adaline network is trained and tested.
- `adaline.rs`: The implementation of the Adaline algorithm, including the `Adaline` struct and related functions.

## Development

This project was developed for educational purposes and is not intended for use as a library.
